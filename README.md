<h3>About</h3>
DERIV-PM stands for derivative problems per minute, a minimalistic typing test with derivative problems, inspired by Monkeytype. To ensure smooth user experience, the problems are automatcally generated based on predefined rules to reduce the latency of the program. 
<h3>How can I generate problems automatically?</h3>
Most of differentiable functions can be separated as chunks. 
<h3>Support</h3>
Although this project was made as a side-project for my high school, there might be bugs scattered across the project and some codes might be unoptimized. Please let me know if you encounter any of those.
